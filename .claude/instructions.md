## File Creation Policy

**Do NOT create summary files, documentation files, or guide files unless explicitly requested by the user.**

This includes but is not limited to:
- Summary files (e.g., `SUMMARY.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`)
- Guide files (e.g., `QUICK_START.md`, `DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md`)
- Documentation files explaining changes
- Tutorial files
- Troubleshooting files

### What to do instead:
- Provide explanations directly in the chat
- Answer questions verbally
- Only create files when the user explicitly asks for them

### Exception:
If the user specifically says "create a file with..." or "make a guide for...", then create the requested file.

---

**Remember: The user will ask if they want a file. Don't assume they need one.**
